# Deep Learning Models for License Plate Restoration

## Overview

This work studies how deep learning models can restore license plate images taken at extreme angles and with added noise. We compare U-Net, Pix2Pix GAN, and diffusion models. The project covers dataset generation, model training, and evaluation by measuring reconstruction quality and OCR accuracy.
